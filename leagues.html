        <h1>Professional Leagues</h1>


In most esports, organized play is centered around the use of promotion and relegation to move sponsored teams between leagues within the competition's organization based on how the team fared in matches; this follows patterns of professional sports in European and Asian countries. However, with rising interest in viewership of esports, some companies sought to create leagues that followed the approach used in North American professional sports, in which all teams participate in a regular season of matches to vie for top standing as to participate in the post-season games. This approach is more attractive for larger investors, who would be more willing to back a team that remains playing in the eSport's premiere league and not threatened to be relegated to a lower standing.[59]

Blizzard Entertainment announced the Overwatch League, based on its Overwatch game, in 2016, with its inaugural regular season featuring twelve teams starting in January 2018. Players that get contracts to play on teams are guaranteed an annual salary and benefits, as well as sharing of the team's revenue and prize winnings; the first season had a total prize pool of US$3.5 million available, with US$1 million to the team winning in post-season.[60]

        Take-Two Interactive partnered with the National Basketball Association (NBA) to create the NBA 2K League, using the NBA 2K game series. It is the first esports league to be operated by a professional sports league, and the NBA sought to have a League team partially sponsored by each of the 30 professional NBA teams. Its inaugural season is set to start May 2018 with 17 teams.[61] Similarly, EA Sports and Major League Soccer (MLS) established the eMLS, an eSport league using EA's FIFA 18; in its inaugural season, 19 of the 23 MLS teams will manage teams for the eMLS.[62]</div><br>
